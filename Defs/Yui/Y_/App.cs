    /// <summary>
    /// Provides a top-level application component which manages navigation and views.
    /// This gives you a foundation and structure on which to build your application; it
    /// combines robust URL navigation with powerful routing and flexible view
    /// management.
    /// `Y.App` is both a namespace and constructor function. The `Y.App` class is
    /// special in that any `Y.App` class extensions that are included in the YUI
    /// instance will be **auto-mixed** on to the `Y.App` class. Consider this example:
    /// YUI().use('app-base', 'app-transitions', function (Y) {
    /// // This will create two YUI Apps, `basicApp` will not have transitions,
    /// // but `fancyApp` will have transitions support included and turn it on.
    /// var basicApp = new Y.App.Base(),
    /// fancyApp = new Y.App({transitions: true});
    /// });
    /// </summary>
