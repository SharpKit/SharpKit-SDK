    /// Adds the ability to make the table rows scrollable while preserving the header
    /// placement.
    /// There are two types of scrolling, horizontal (x) and vertical (y).  Horizontal
    /// scrolling is achieved by wrapping the entire table in a scrollable container.
    /// Vertical scrolling is achieved by splitting the table headers and data into two
    /// separate tables, the latter of which is wrapped in a vertically scrolling
    /// container.  In this case, column widths of header cells and data cells are kept
    /// in sync programmatically.
    /// Since the split table synchronization can be costly at runtime, the split is only done if the data in the table stretches beyond the configured `height` value.
    /// To activate or deactivate scrolling, set the `scrollable` attribute to one of
    /// the following values:
    /// * `false` - (default) Scrolling is disabled.
    /// * `true` or 'xy' - If `height` is set, vertical scrolling will be activated, if
    /// `width` is set, horizontal scrolling will be activated.
    /// * 'x' - Activate horizontal scrolling only. Requires the `width` attribute is
    /// also set.
    /// * 'y' - Activate vertical scrolling only. Requires the `height` attribute is
    /// also set.
